# Bank-Loan-Finance-Project-Using-Tableau-and-SQL

Embarking on a data-driven journey, I integrated Tableau's visualization prowess with SQL's analytical capabilities to dissect and present intricate insights into a bank's loan and finance operations. From loan approval rates to customer credit profiles, this project navigates the complex terrain of financial data.

Key Highlights:

Interactive Dashboards: Crafted visually appealing and user-friendly dashboards, providing an intuitive overview of the bank's loan portfolio.
Risk Analysis: Utilized SQL queries to assess and visualize potential risks associated with different types of loans and customer demographics.
Performance Metrics: Implemented key performance indicators (KPIs) through Tableau, aiding in the continuous monitoring and optimization of financial strategies.

Addressing the need for comprehensive financial reporting, the "Bank Loan Finance Project" seamlessly integrates SQL and Tableau to provide in-depth insights into key loan metrics and trends. The dashboard includes an impactful summary, categorizing loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts. It distinguishes 'Good Loans' from 'Bad Loans' based on specific status criteria, shedding light on application percentages and funding details for each category. Additionally, a grid view report categorizes loan statuses, offering a comprehensive overview of key indicators. The overview dashboard utilizes various chart types, showcasing monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term distribution, employment history impact, loan purposes breakdown, and home ownership analysis. Lastly, a detailed dashboard consolidates critical loan-related metrics for a holistic snapshot. This project aims to empower data-driven decision-making and strategic planning within our lending operations. 

Impact:
This project empowers financial institutions to make informed decisions, enhance risk management strategies, and optimize their loan portfolios for sustained growth in an ever-evolving market.
